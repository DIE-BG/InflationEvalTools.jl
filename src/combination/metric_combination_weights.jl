Obtains optimal combination weights for the metric `metric` through
an iterative approximation to the optimization problem of that metric for the
linear combination of inflation estimators in `tray_infl` using the parametric
inflation trajectory `tray_infl_param`.

Optional parameters: 
- `metric::Symbol = :corr`: metric to optimize. If it is linear correlation,
  the metric is maximized. The rest of the metrics are minimized. See also
  [`eval_metrics`](@ref).
- `w_start = nothing`: initial search weights. Typically, a vector of floating
  point values.
- `x_abstol::AbstractFloat = 1f-2`: maximum absolute deviation of the weights. 
- `f_abstol::AbstractFloat = 1f-4`: maximum absolute deviation in the cost
  function.
- `sum_abstol::AbstractFloat = 1f-2`: maximum permissible absolute deviation in
  the sum of weights, with respect to one.
- `max_iterations::Int = 1000`: maximum number of iterations. 

Returns a vector with the weights associated with each estimator in the
columns of `tray_infl`.
